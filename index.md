## FileSender Project

FileSender is a web based application that allows authenticated users to securely and easily send arbitrarily large files to other users.

We have recently moved the project from Assembla to GitHub.  The old Assembla project pages are still available, but should no longer be seen as the primary source of information.

### Information for users

You've reached the page for FileSender administrators and developers.  This may not be what you were looking for.

### Information for administrators

Download FileSender free of charge and install it on your own infrastructure, regardless if you're profit or non-profit.  Everybody is free to use our software as they please.
